Well, it’s\ntime to get off the Internet and tell us about it face to face. We’ll\nprovide you with our honest feedback, you provide us with a great hack,\nor idea.</p>\n<p>We’ll give you 5 minutes to show off your tool, hack, library (did you\njust write a library to access the Meetup API in Go!?), whatever. We’re\nlanguage and software/hardware agnostic, so it’s all fair game.</p>\n<p>Your project doesn’t have to be a software project. We’re using a very\nbroad definition of hacking. Anything customized or personalized counts.\nPlease don’t feel shy.</p>\n<p>After you present, it’s an open forum. The audience will ask questions\nand provide feedback. We want to enable as much participation as\npossible at these meetups, so you’d better be able to take criticism and\ndish it out (all within reason of course).</p>\n'
