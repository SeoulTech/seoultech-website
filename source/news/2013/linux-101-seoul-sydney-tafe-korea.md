Linux is a free and open source operating system which is gaining
momentum and is a great alternative to other more well marketed OS’s. 

In this talk I will cover some history and present some advantages (and
disadvantages) of the Linux OS, without getting too technical. Whats
good, whats new and how can we benefit from this awesome free operating
system. 

Learn about the tech that is running the majority of web servers,
multiple embedded devices, and even your android phones. Browse the
source code, build your own distro, conquer the world… did I mention it
was free? 

**Location:** Sydney TAFE Korea

8th floor, Seoul Hyundai Occupational Training College.

Near Dangsan (당산) station, green line exit 3.
