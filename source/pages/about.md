#About us

## "No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world." — Tom Schulman, Dead Poets Society

### Who we are
Seoul Tech Society is an international non-profit organization based in Seoul. It was founded in 2013 with aim to build and unite tech community all around Korea and beyond.

### What we do
Technology is our passion so we hold open monthly meetings to collaborate on projects, learn from each other or share knowledge through conference-like sessions.  

Our interests are not centered around a specific area, all digital technologies and IT related topics are honored and welcome: mobile & wearable electronics, software, web, robotics, UX, Computer Science, Maths, etc.

If you are an expat interested in the Seoul tech scene or a Korean netizen interested expanding abroad, come and join us for networking and discussion, and of course a few drinks.

### How to apply to present
A science, engineering or technology professional? Want to share your knowledge and passion? Need a stage to present your successful startup?

If you would like to be one of our guest speakers and reach out to the international tech community of Seoul, drop us an email at contacts@seoultechsociety.org or RSVP on the next event, we’ll be glad to hear from you!
