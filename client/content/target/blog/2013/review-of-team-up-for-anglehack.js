The atmosphere was\ncreative and cheerful, we generated 11 project proposals to compete in\nAngelHack contest. After hectic discussions 3 the most promising ideas\nwere chosen so 3 teams will participate in the hackathon.</p>\n<p>Wish a good luck to our heroes!!</p>\n<p>To chill out our burning brains later on we threw an after-party with a\ncold beer or two.</p>\n<p>As so many people were involved, excited and committed we decided to\nmake one more meeting before the actual AngelHack contest.</p>\n<p>Special shout out goes to our\nfriends <a href=\'http://www.nflabs.com/\' title=\'NFLabs\'><strong>NFLabs</strong></a> who hosted this\nevent at their nice office at Gangnam and helped most generously with,\nhm, let us say “refreshments” and “stuff”.</p>\n'
