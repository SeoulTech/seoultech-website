<p>All details in the link, but for those who don’t know what a Game Jam
is… They are going to try to make a few brand new games in a very short
amount of time. No pressure though because people of all skill levels
will be participating and the goal is simply to make something!</p>

events where you can show off your creation and play other games.\^\^</p>
