<p>Firstly a big thank you to all those of you who attended and supported
the event. It was our largest yet, with 20+ attendees and we’re pleased
to see that true community grows.</p>
<p>As planned this meetup consisted of two parts:</p>
<p><strong>Free Talk at TOZ Sinchon</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>where we made a short presentation of the Seoul Tech Society itself</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/SeoulTechSociety/seoul-tech-society" title="Introduction to Seoul Tech Society">Introduction to Seoul Tech
Society</a></strong>
and then had a discussion session on <em>“Modern Tech Opportunities in
Korea”</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/SeoulTechSociety/tech-opportunities-in-korea"></a><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/SeoulTechSociety/tech-opportunities-in-korea">http://www.slideshare.net/SeoulTechSociety/tech-opportunities-in-korea</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of good tech topics popped up so event 2 hours was not enough to
get to the last slide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Afterparty</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rest of the evening all of us spend together at the nearest pub,
socializing and discussing a truly broad range of topics: from Berlin
startup scene and mobile OS code bases up to Pushkin and international
affairs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was wonderful (and nobody expected that) to see what an international
crowd attended the event: people all over the Europe, South America, US
and Republic of  Korea of course. That was the diversity we are up to!
People with different backgrounds, cultures, languages got together to
meet others who are smart, educated, enthusiastic and young at their
hearts to share skills, knowledge and passion in business and
technology.</p>
<p>Through the evening a few things were noted as missing: a <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SeoulTechSociety">Seoul Tech
Society Facebook page</a></strong>
which now exists, as the brand new twitter account
does <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/Seoul_Tech">@Seoul_Tech</a></strong>, so feel free to
follow news and updates with the way which is more convenient to you.
Both channels will be used  to deliver news, updates, announce events
etc.</p>
<p>We are also <em>exploring ways to work, share and interact</em> altogether as a
community: what is the most convenient way to exchange links, suggest
discussion topics and speakers you are interested to listen to on our
next meetups?</p>
<ul>
<li>Would plain-old forum work for your?</li>
<li>Is google+ too geeky</li>
<li>or are we eager to get something reddit\hacker’s news style these
webX.Y days?</li>
</ul>
<p>We’d like to know what you think!</p>
