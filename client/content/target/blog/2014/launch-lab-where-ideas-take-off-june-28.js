These\nevents allow members  to get involved with the creation of new ideas or\nstartups, while forging friendships and business partnerships to last a\nlifetime. </p>\n<p><strong>How? </strong></p>\n<p>The event features a group of speakers that give a 10 to 15 minute\npresentation of their idea. The audience then discusses the idea.\nAudience members can also choose to join or further contribute to the\nproject.</p>\n<p>Open discussion sessions will also be available, so if anyone gets\ninspired they can share and discuss their ideas with the group.</p>\n<p><strong>When?</strong></p>\n<p><em>June 28th, 2014</em></p>\n<p>13:00 - 17:00: Presentations + Discussion + Coffee/Beer/Snacks</p>\n<p>17:00 - 19:00: Dinner (possible group discount depending on number)</p>\n<p>19:00 - 21:00: Open Mic Music Session</p>\n<p><strong>Call for projects and proposals (and musicians)!</strong></p>\n<p>If you are a researcher, startup founder, entrepreneur, idea generator,\nor dreamer, sign up to be a speaker!</p>\n<p>If you want to play in the Open Mic night, please let us know.
