It would be enough to say that this time event was SUPER fun &
challenging.

Review in a brief:

-   \~20 people attended
-   11 cool project ideas were proposed
-   3 most promising were chosen by voting
-   ..to be continue - a plan for one more meeting exists!

Some juicy details for whose who interested:

The event was popular far beyond the expectation - more than 90% of RSVP
showed up - \~20 highly skilled tech enthusiasts. The atmosphere was
creative and cheerful, we generated 11 project proposals to compete in
AngelHack contest. After hectic discussions 3 the most promising ideas
were chosen so 3 teams will participate in the hackathon.

Wish a good luck to our heroes!!

To chill out our burning brains later on we threw an after-party with a
cold beer or two.

As so many people were involved, excited and committed we decided to
make one more meeting before the actual AngelHack contest.

Special shout out goes to our
friends [**NFLabs**](http://www.nflabs.com/ "NFLabs") who hosted this
event at their nice office at Gangnam and helped most generously with,
hm, let us say “refreshments” and “stuff”.
