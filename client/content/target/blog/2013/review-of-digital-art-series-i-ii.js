Her talk took\nattendees on a fascinating journey through this colorful area of\nconverging technologies.  Where Musicians, Designers, Entrepreneurs,\nFilmmakers, Writers, Architects, Hackers, Inventors, Engineers,\nUrbanists, Scientists, Choreographers as well as Magicians are currently\nfinding new ways to use technology in their practices.</p>\n<p>You can find the slides for ‘Introduction to Digital Art I’ here:\n<a href=\'https://www.dropbox.com/s/72oekls988u494w/digital_art_lecture_1_lucia_lee.ppt\'></a><a href=\'https://www.dropbox.com/s/72oekls988u494w/digital_art_lecture_1_lucia_lee.ppt\'>https://www.dropbox.com/s/72oekls988u494w/digital_art_lecture_1_lucia_lee.ppt</a></p>\n<p>The intrigued audience hurried to her second lecture, ’Introduction to\nDigital Art II - Mapping’, where she took them deeper into the curious\nworld of online digital mapping.   Lucia’s solid selection of artists\nand her thoughtful interpretations helped a very eager audience to see\nhow images of our modern, sometimes hectic world, once frozen in time\ncould be appropriated and transformed into expressive and highly\nunconventional pieces of contemporary art.  In addition, she kindly\nprovided some great resources for those looking to jump in and do their\nown projects.</p>\n<p>Both her lectures were enriched with lively discussions at the end as\nwell as a very enjoyable after-parties.</p>\n<p>These valuable events couldn’t have happened without the generous\nsupport of two great organizations, Hub Seoul and World Culture Open\nSeoul Office, who graciously opened up their wonderful venues to Seoul\nTech Society members.</p>\n<p><strong>Hub Seoul</strong>\\\n<img src=\'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9QPjmwC57S5muRmizwQHYCDqfgGYWVGF3xYdzF-4TmvtXrOk2TYUFVAAocRtFrfJobjAEiScUlWxwOD6MJF3a0Ty5d50fhET3uHx0nVq002nNTFkDoynfHRL\' alt=\'image\'>\\\n<strong>WCO</strong>\\\n<img src=\'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PqLzDtQvhxhCmQcSHB5gA226FEl7hGrXsXh8-rqmOo7jdqdEJBUuTq7unWYoB2IsCL_pUCDv3cLt8NAlINEu72HcB6qTRtl0yGZ4C4FrXaweETpvMn9iFJBr\' alt=\'image\'></p>\n<p><strong>Hub Seoul</strong> <a href=\'http://www.hubseoul.net\'>www.hubseoul.net</a> /\n<a href=\'http://www.facebook.com/hubseoul\'>www.facebook.com/hubseoul</a>\\\nis originally a quite co-working space, where everyone can find a handy\ncorner to concentrate on their project, for a reasonable fee.\\\nFor us, It smoothly transformed in a space, which welcomed our first\nevent.
