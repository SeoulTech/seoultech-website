The registration is on March, 12. <a href="https://code.google.com/codejam" class="linkified">https://code.google.com/codejam</a></p> <p>For free, practice algorithms, have fun and may travel to London and win $15,000*.</p> <p> </p> <p>And I've just got the idea that we can refresh our knowledge of algorithms together.</p> <p><b>Moreover</b>, we are very lucky because Prof. David Wagner of Algorithms and Programming at Hanyang University agreed to give us a brief overview of the algorithms.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you have any programming experience, give it a try. The competition is not easy at all but will be a good experience.</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Place</b></p> <p>Currently, I plan to do it at my home where there may be place for 6~10 people and we can meet for free. This is a specific topic so I don't expect that more than 10 people will join.</p> <p>But everyone is welcome and can bring friends. If more people join by Friday, we can move to a seminar room of TOZ(<a href="http://www.toz.co.kr/index.htm" class="linkified">http://www.toz.co.kr/index.htm</a>) at Gangnam or Jonggak where only 6,000won/person should be paid for 2 hours (If you are a student, you may not need to pay).</p> <p><b>Activity</b></p> <p>- Listen to tips from Prof. David</p> <p>- Share knowledge of algorithms</p> <p>- Code examples from previous Code Jams</p> <p> </p> <p>P.S. This is the meetup of the nonstandard form.</p> <p>But a common meetup is coming soon in March.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you have questions or won't be able to find the place of the meetup, please call to my number 010-9426-7394.</p> <p>* If you win the main prize and feel that Prof. David contributed to that achievement, I will suggest to share 10% with him.</p></div></div></div>
