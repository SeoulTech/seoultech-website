Guys, we are just a few weeks from AngleHack 2013 contest, let’s get
prepared to take part and win!

[Last time at
NFLabs](http://seoultechsociety.org/post/49421013070/team-up-for-angelhack-seoul-may-10)
it was a really productive session: we pre-selected three ideas and lots
of stuff has been done by teams of devoted techies from that time so…

Let’s get together once more at [D.Camp](http://dreamcamp.co) (thanks to
their support)  and review our progress, refine goals and tactics to get
ready for the show time! As usual please RSVP at [Seoul Tech Society
meetup
page](http://www.meetup.com/seoul-tech-society/events/120815772/).

So just to re-cap:
