Well, it's time to get off the Internet and tell us about it face to face. We'll provide you with our honest feedback, you provide us with a great hack, or idea.</p> <p>We'll give you 5 minutes to show off your tool, hack, library (did you just write a library to access the Meetup API in Go!?), whatever. We're language and software/hardware agnostic, so it's all fair game.</p> <p>Your project doesn't have to be a software project. We're using a very broad definition of hacking. Anything customized or personalized counts. Please don't feel shy.</p> <p>After you present, it's an open forum. The audience will ask questions and provide feedback. We want to enable as much participation as possible at these meetups, so you'd better be able to take criticism and dish it out (all within reason of course).</p> <p> </p></div></div></div>
