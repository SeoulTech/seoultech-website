<p>RSVP <a href="http://www.meetup.com/seoul-tech-society/events/187283782/">http://www.meetup.com/seoul-tech-society/events/187283782/</a></p>
<p><strong>What is LaunchLab? </strong></p>
<p>As part of the Launch - Hack - Tell cycle of innovation, SeoulTech is
proud to announce the “Launch Lab” series of meetups.  This is a new
type of event where researchers, entrepreneurs and innovators discuss
and propose (any) project, and solicit ideas and help from other
SeoulTech members.</p>
<p><img src="http://localhost:8080/source/images/blog/2014/launch-lab-poster.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Why? </strong></p>
<p>Launch Lab helps members take one giant leap beyond networking. These
events allow members  to get involved with the creation of new ideas or
startups, while forging friendships and business partnerships to last a
lifetime. </p>
<p><strong>How? </strong></p>
<p>The event features a group of speakers that give a 10 to 15 minute
presentation of their idea. The audience then discusses the idea.
Audience members can also choose to join or further contribute to the
project.</p>
<p>Open discussion sessions will also be available, so if anyone gets
inspired they can share and discuss their ideas with the group.</p>
<p><strong>When?</strong></p>
<p><em>June 28th, 2014</em></p>
<p>13:00 - 17:00: Presentations + Discussion + Coffee/Beer/Snacks</p>
<p>17:00 - 19:00: Dinner (possible group discount depending on number)</p>

or dreamer, sign up to be a speaker!</p>

<p><strong>Note: This event is currently hosted outside of Seoul (Jukjeon -
accessible by bus or Seoul Metro, 25 mins from Gangnam) - think as a
half day picnic-style relaxing event. If we cannot get 20+ to RSVP, the
main event will be moved to Seoul. Please check the map before
RSVPing.</strong></p>
