What made this usable was a \"Window Manager\". It gave you titlebars, the ability to move windows, resize them, virtual desktops, focus management etc. etc. ... At the time I had tried various Window Managers, and not being happy with Any of them I decided to teach myself C as a language, learn X11 and the raw libraries it was based on, and build myself a Window Manager. Now about 19 years later and over 1 million lines of C code still standing (not to mention all the code written, thrown away and replaced), a career now centered around it, It wasn't so hard, but I had no idea what I was getting into.
