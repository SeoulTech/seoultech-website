If you are interested in learning about RaspberryPi, you are welcome to visit this lecture <b>for free</b>. </p> <p><i>Bonus</i>: you will get the chance to visit a real Fabrication Laboratory—a truly unique environment, and learn about technologies and benefits provided there.</p> <p>Those who want to get their hands on RaspberryPi and make something real are welcome to participate in the subsequent series of workshops over the next four weeks.</p> <p><a href="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSU_qvh3dhFJmhnWkTo3uWGASJJ03OTVY23IOa9jUGeJRv9XLuCpA" class="linkified">http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSU_qvh3dhFJmhnWkTo3uWGASJJ03OTVY23IOa9jUGeJRv9XLuCpA</a></p> <p><b>RaspberryPi Workshop</b></p> <p>This series of workshops is focused around the idea that we should not just make “things”, but that we should be innovating, experimenting, creating tools and systems that take us one step closer in understanding how our world works. By understanding how our world works, we are empowered to reshape our world!!</p> <p>The outcome of these workshops will be an RFID logging and access system. Through designing and building this system, this series of workshops will teach:</p> <p>• The basics of the Raspberry Pi platform</p> <p>• Programming with the Python language</p> <p>• Basic MySql database structure and commands</p> <p>• Serial communication</p> <p>• RFID technology</p> <p>• Basic Electricity (with soldering)</p> <p><b>The series of workshops is ₩40,000 which will be put towards food and beverages for each workshop! </b>At the end of the workshops, each participant has the option to purchase their Raspberry Pi.!</p> <p><b>About Todd Holoubek</b></p> <p>Todd Holoubek, is raised on a small farm in Ixonia, Wisconsin.
