**What is LaunchLab? **

As part of the Launch - Hack - Tell cycle of innovation, SeoulTech is
proud to announce the “Launch Lab” series of meetups.  This is a new
type of event where researchers, entrepreneurs and innovators discuss
and propose (any) project, and solicit ideas and help from other
SeoulTech members.

**Why? **

Launch Lab helps members take one giant leap beyond networking. These
events allow members  to get involved with the creation of new ideas or
startups, while forging friendships and business partnerships to last a
lifetime. 

**How? **

The event features a group of speakers that give a 10 to 15 minute
presentation of their idea. The audience then discusses the idea.
Audience members can also choose to join or further contribute to the
project.

Open discussion sessions will also be available, so if anyone gets
inspired they can share and discuss their ideas with the group.

**When?**

*June 28th, 2014*

13:00 - 17:00: Presentations + Discussion + Coffee/Beer/Snacks

17:00 - 19:00: Dinner (possible group discount depending on number)

19:00 - 21:00: Open Mic Music Session

**Call for projects and proposals (and musicians)!**

If you are a researcher, startup founder, entrepreneur, idea generator,
or dreamer, sign up to be a speaker!

If you want to play in the Open Mic night, please let us know. Guitar
will be provided.

half day picnic-style relaxing event. If we cannot get 20+ to RSVP, the
main event will be moved to Seoul. Please check the map before
RSVPing.**
