<p>It would be enough to say that this time event was SUPER fun &amp;
challenging.</p>
<p>Review in a brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>~20 people attended</li>
<li>11 cool project ideas were proposed</li>
<li>3 most promising were chosen by voting</li>
<li>..to be continue - a plan for one more meeting exists!</li>
</ul>
<p>Some juicy details for whose who interested:</p>
<p>The event was popular far beyond the expectation - more than 90% of RSVP
showed up - ~20 highly skilled tech enthusiasts. The atmosphere was
creative and cheerful, we generated 11 project proposals to compete in
AngelHack contest. After hectic discussions 3 the most promising ideas
were chosen so 3 teams will participate in the hackathon.</p>
<p>Wish a good luck to our heroes!!</p>
<p>To chill out our burning brains later on we threw an after-party with a
cold beer or two.</p>
<p>As so many people were involved, excited and committed we decided to
make one more meeting before the actual AngelHack contest.</p>
<p>Special shout out goes to our
friends <a href="http://www.nflabs.com/" title="NFLabs"><strong>NFLabs</strong></a> who hosted this
event at their nice office at Gangnam and helped most generously with,
hm, let us say “refreshments” and “stuff”.</p>
