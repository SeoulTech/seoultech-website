All details in the link, but for those who don’t know what a Game Jam
is… They are going to try to make a few brand new games in a very short
amount of time. No pressure though because people of all skill levels
will be participating and the goal is simply to make something!

Other Important Info:

Wednesday 2pm - Friday 5pm is the official time but this is a causal +
fun event so everyone is invited and can come participate as much or as
little as desired. 

It’s FREE! + Saturday and Sunday night we will have some related social
events where you can show off your creation and play other games.\^\^

Directions:

Dangsan Station Exit 4. Turn left, walk down the street to the second
building. Enter and come to the 3rd Floor.
